- To create the required dtabase table in MySQL you should open a new terminal in the project the run 'php artisan auth' (you can skip this because the project has the auth folder already) followed by the 'php artisan migrate' command (CRUCIAL FOR TABLE CREATION). This will create the table needed for logging in and registration. 
-Confirm the database and database table were created by accessing (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) then clicking on propertybook. The table should have at least 3 important data columns, namely: "name, email and password" along with other columns.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).



Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
